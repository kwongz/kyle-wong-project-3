The header taking 100vh with the text "Daily Water Calculator

A H2 below describing the importance of drinking water, and how is varies based on multiple factors, in this case Weight, Activity and Climate 

A form is located below with 3 inputs and a submit button at the end of the form

the first is a text input prompting the user to input their weight in lbs

the second input is a radio input with 3 options asking the user to describe their activity level ranging from low, moderate and high

the third input is a radio input with 3 options asking the user to describe the climate they live at ranging from cold, moder and hot. 

upon submission of the form the data will be collected nad the inputs from the activity level and climate will determine a multiplier on the users weight to determine the amount of "daily drinking water in ounces" and stored in a variable, "dailyWater".

the "dailyWater" variable will then be passed as an argument through a function to convert it into cups and stored in a varaible, "dailyWaterCups".

"dailyWaterCups" will then be appended to the H2 of the last section and be displayed to the user. A Scroll function will also be used to direct the user attention

Stretch Goals: 

Add a option that will allow users to input weight in kg or lbs 

add a button by the returned "dailyWaterCups" to be converted into litres

To a function that will determine how much water a user should drink in a hour to get their dailyWaterCups intake within 8 hours.

create an alert that will notify the user that at the end of each hour, the user should have drank their hourly "dailyWaterCups"

create a alert to remind the user to stand up and stretch/exercise/move









//create array for both activity and Climate


// create a function that takes the weight and combined index value variables and multiply them

// create a function that converts ounces into cups

// prevent default of form submit

// target value of weight input (and parseint string into numbers?) and store it into a variable, create a alert IF a non-numerical value or no value is entered.

// target value of activity, and get the index number of that value
// store it in a variable
// target value of climate, and get the index number of that value
// store it in a variable

// add the index values of the activity and climate and create a conditional statement if the values = 2 then multiply the weight by 0.5
//  2 < value < 6 multiply by 0.75
//  value = 6 multiply by 1 
// store that combined index value into a variable 

// call weight * index value function which will give you the amount of daily water required in ounces, store it in a varaible

// take the daily water required variable and put it into the function that converts ounces into cups

// update the section, that will then display "you need _____ cups of water a day"
